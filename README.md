This is my beginner data analytics project using my Apple Health data.  
I used **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** to clean, analyze, and visualize data about my steps, heart rate, and activity.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Project Goals
- Explore health patterns from daily activity
- Visualize trends using graphs
- Practice Python data analysis

### Results
Found that my average daily steps increased over the past year and heart rate was more stable during consistent sleep routines.
